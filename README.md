## ğŸ§  About

This project aims to provide an accessible credit risk prediction tool that can help banks, NBFCs, and fintech startups assess the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan.

It leverages machine learning techniques to classify loan applicants as either "Good" or "Bad" risk based on various features like income, age, loan amount, credit history, etc.
